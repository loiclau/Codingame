## Statement

The goal of the problem is to simulate an old airport terminal display: your program must display a line of text in ASCII art.
You have to split strings, store them and recreate others. You can use data structures like arrays or hash tables.

## Story

Do you feel you are an artist at heart? Unfortunately you are a programmer :( Why not give a try at ...

   __    ___   ___  ____  ____      __    ____  ____ 
  /__\  / __) / __)(_  _)(_  _)    /__\  (  _ \(_  _)
 /(__)\ \__ \( (__  _)(_  _)(_    /(__)\  )   /  )(  
(__)(__)(___/ \___)(____)(____)  (__)(__)(_)\_) (__)
