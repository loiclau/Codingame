## Statement

Given a list of numbers, you have to find not the minimal value but the maximal drop. Be careful that a drop can span on several values!

## Story

You sometimes have to take risks buying market shares, and sometimes you have to know when it's time to sell before you lose everything. This is why we propose a little puzzle, to write a program that will do the maths for us, a program in which we can invest all our trust (and money?!).

Don't worry, you won't have to be a market expert, nothing is going to crash.
