## Statement

The goal of this puzzle is to store multiple phone numbers in a compact way, using a tree data structure, then count all the nodes there are in this tree. Be careful that you may need several tree roots.

##Â Story

Dang, all those telephone numbers are impossible to remember! What if we were to invent a new way to store phone numbers so that they take the least memory space? It is your task today to achieve that hard work. Then call me, maybe ?
